    <h3>The best waldorf salad</h3>
    <p>
        A Waldorf salad is a fruit and nut salad generally made
        of celety, fresh apples, walnuts, and grapes, dressed in mayonnaise,
        and traditionally served on a bed of lettuce as an appetizer or an light meal.
        The apples, celery, and grapes can all be green, which
        harmonizes the color palette of the dish.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Waldorf Salad is named for the Waldorf-Astoria
        hotel in New York City, where it was created for a charity
        ball given in honor of the St. Mary's Hospital for Children
        on March 13, 1896.
